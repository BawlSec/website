Hi, I’m Robert McCallum.

You might also know me as M42D, Base5 or Drubes.

I recently discovered that i'm a hacker and have had been a hacker all my life.

Part of me already knew this, but I’ve had been repressing it for years. Trying to live a life as a cook, electrical engineer, process operator, service engineer. It all didn’t feel good to me.

I love:

- Reverse engineering software and hardware.
- Learning how things work.
- Finding bugs.
- Finding ways to exploit these bugs.

November 2018 I got into playing CTF.

December 2018 I founded the BawlSec CTF team.

I am now looking to find a job as a reverse engineer or pen tester.
