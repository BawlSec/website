<h2>About the team</h2>
<p>
	The BawlSec team is super cool
	and is not spending their time<br /> drawing balls at all.
	Nope. Just regular old fashioned awesomeness.
</p>

<p>
	Also, we have a mascot! <b>BAWL-E</b>. He's a very cute server.
</p>

<p>
	But you want to know what we're about.

<div class="side_by_side tea">
	<p>
		Besides tools, knowledge, and reading<br /> docs three hours too late, we believe<br />in the power of trial and error.
		<br /><br />
		That's probably why we're more into coffee than tea. <br />
		We need the caffeine.
